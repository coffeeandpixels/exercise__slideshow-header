# Exercise: CSS-Only Header Slideshow

Just a little experiment where I learned to make a CSS-only slideshow with CSS sprites.

The header element utilises a CSS animation to cycle through five background images. Only one background image file needs loading. It contains five 1920px*1280px images side-by-side. The animation simply shifts the background-position property.
